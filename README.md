# To The Stars! - OneGameAMonth - August 2013

## Overview
This is a simple 2D game that involves no user interaction beyond simple
mouse-clicks (or screen-touches if run on a mobile device).

## Dependencies

* [jaws - Javascript graphics library](https://github.com/ippa/jaws)

I've included the library in the src directory so that this project contains
the correct version of it, in case later versions introduce breaking changes
(though as it hasn't been updated recently, this seems unlikely).
